# Task 3 - Example calculator (using stacks)

## Description

This is a simple calculator that uses stacks to perform arithmetic operations. It supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**I HOPE YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER!**

PS: You can try to add more operations, such as `()`, `^`, etc. Or you can make it more user-friendly by adding a GUI(html files).
